Project Proposal: Have there ever been moments when living with your roommates and you feel like you've been purchasing all the common groceries? Or maybe you've been doing the grunt of the chores? Wouldn't it be great to have an easy way to keep track and update this information? A roommate app that allows for seamless interactions between roommates regarding important household duties. Some features could include a way to split expenses for common groceries or meals, splitting up chores equally, and shared calendar capabities. This app will tend to a variety of users in all aspects of their lives: from roommates in college to families living together. Allow RoomMate to be your extra "roommate" and take care of roommate logistics for you!
